# chat-from-sockets
A simple Linux chat server and client application using the Linux socket API.

This project has been undertaken in order to learn more about basic network programming and concurrent systems in a Linux environment.
The plan is to slowly add features and eventually build out a functional instant messenging service without the use of any libraries.
